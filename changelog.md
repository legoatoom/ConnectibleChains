### Fixes

- Fixed bug of randomly broken chains when one end is in an unloaded
  chunk. [#68](https://github.com/legoatoom/ConnectibleChains/issues/68)
- While leading animals, right-clicking with a lead in hand now first tries to attach animals to a
  fence. [#65](https://github.com/legoatoom/ConnectibleChains/issues/65)
- Connecting to existing uses the correct sound. [#64](https://github.com/legoatoom/ConnectibleChains/issues/64)

## [2.4.2] - 12024-08-15
- Fixed pick block bug where you would always get a vanilla chain.

## [2.4.1] - 12024-06-14
- The mod now uses `connectiblechains:catenary_items` tag for allowed items to be used that are not chains.
- Leads are now also available to use as catenary.
- Fixed bug where custom textures were working on initial launch.
- Items now grab the sound of their block variant, if there isn't one, it defaults to chains.
- The chain drip function is altered sightly to decrease drip for longer chains.
- Added `es_mx` translation by courtesy of [TheLegendofSaram](https://github.com/TheLegendofSaram)
  - Copied language to `es_ar`,`es_cl`,`es_ec`, `es_es`, `es_uy`, and `es_ve`.
  - If you noticed any mistake due to regional differences in the Spanish language, make an issue or pull request.
- Added `ru_ru` translation by courtesy of [Alexander317](https://github.com/Alexander317)

## [2.4.0] - 12024-06-06
- Reworking Networking again since it changed again.
- Increased visibility range, equal to other entities, like chests.
- Default max range increased from 7 to 16.
- Reworked Tag system to use the `fabric-convention-tags-v2`.
- Reworked how the mod grabs textures for the `knot` and `chain` texture.
  - For every item in the `chains` convention tag, we check if JSON files is located at
  `<mod-id>/models/entity/connectiblechains/<item_id>.json`, see the `chain.json` file on GitHub for an example.
  - If this file is missing, the default locations (what currently happens) are used.
  - Note: Animated textures do **not** work.
  

## [2.3.0] - 12024-03-30
- Reworked Networking to conform with new standard.
- Removed all mixins, as they were no longer needed (I hope).
- Added `c:bars` tags and allowed chains to be connected to iron bars.
- Minecraft version 1.20.4

## [2.2.1] - 12023-06-29
- Fixed texture bug when having one chain in hand.

## [2.2.0] - 12023-04-16
- Fix Tooltip Config not Working
- Added new text for the tooltip.
- Reworked the compatibility to be tag-based.
  - Using `data/c/tags/items/chains.json` we check if an item can be used to make a catenary.\
  The code then assumes an `item` and `block`texture for the `knot` and `catenary`. \
  This implies that you can make anything a compatible chain, as long as you have textures available.
  For modded players, you need to add a data pack where you  add tags for the chain items you want added.
